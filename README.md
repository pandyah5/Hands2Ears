# Visual-sensing-project
The project has the potential to develop into a tool that converts sign language to spoken languages this will help all people who suffer from auditory impairment interact with society more actively. This can be integrated with all the existing translators to ensure that sign language can be converted into a plethora of languages ensuring universal communication ability for these people.
